            Just check out these messages from my satisfied customers!
<br><br>
Kyle: Yeah one time, Cartman did a good job of finding my iPhone, but I still can't understand how he sleeps at night charging fifty bucks an hour for basically unskilled labor.
<br><br>
Stan: Well, he did get the job done after eating about 4 family sized bags of doritos which I payed for.

<h2>Satisfaction guaranteed</h2>
<p>I charge hourly and with a flat daily fee as well as expenses and snacks.  It's $50 an hour, a minimum of $100, and I eat a lot of snacks.  You can reach me by e-mail ( cwizdude@gmail.com ) or come over to my house at 908 Carpenter Rd, and I think I'll get a phone next Christmas, so I'll add that later.</p>
