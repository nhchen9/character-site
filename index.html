<h2>Satisfaction guaranteed(notreallylol)</h2>
<p>I charge hourly and with a flat daily fee as well as expenses and snacks.  It's $50 an hour, a minimum of $100, and I eat a lot of snacks.  You can reach me by e-mail ( cwizdude@gmail.com ) or come over to my house at 908 Carpenter Rd, and I think I'll get a phone next Christmas, so I'll add that later.</p>
